    <h2><li>Playing Games: One of my hobbies</li></h2>
        <p> I liked playing online games from my school days. </p>
        <p> Especially, I love playing game of the FPS genre. My favorite game these days is called <strong>"PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUND."</strong> </p>
        <p> To briefly explain this game, up to 100 players are surviving and doing battle to take the No.1 ranking.</p>
